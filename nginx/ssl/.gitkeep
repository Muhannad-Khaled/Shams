# This directory is for SSL certificates
# Add your cert.pem and key.pem files here for production

# To generate self-signed certificates for testing:
# openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
#   -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem \
#   -subj "/CN=localhost"

# For production, use Let's Encrypt (certbot) or your CA
